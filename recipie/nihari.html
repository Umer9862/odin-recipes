      <h2>Description</h2>
    </center>
    <p>
      Nihari is a flavorful and slow-cooked stew that originated in South Asia.
      It is known for its rich and aromatic broth, tender meat, and a blend of
      traditional spices. Typically served as a hearty breakfast or a
      celebratory dish, Nihari has become a beloved comfort food. The stew is
      often prepared with beef or lamb, and the slow cooking process allows the
      flavors to meld, resulting in a deliciously tender and savory dish.

      <li>
        Heat oil or ghee in a large pot. Sauté sliced onions until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Add minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add meat and bones to the pot, and brown them for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in the spice mix (Nihari masala) and cook for a couple of minutes
        until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and
        simmer for several hours until the meat is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the stew needs thickening, mix flour with water to create a smooth
        paste and stir it into the pot. Cook until the stew reaches the desired
        consistency.

      <li>Season with salt to taste.</li>
