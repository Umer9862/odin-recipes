      <h2>Description</h2>
    </center>
    <p>
      White sauce pasta is a delectable Italian-inspired dish featuring pasta
      coated in a creamy and velvety white sauce. The sauce, also known as
      béchamel, is made by whisking butter, flour, and milk together to create a
      smooth, luxurious texture. Commonly infused with garlic for added flavor,
      this pasta dish is versatile and can be customized with various
      ingredients such as cheese, herbs, and vegetables. The result is a
      comforting and satisfying meal that combines the richness of the sauce
      with the simplicity of perfectly cooked pasta.
